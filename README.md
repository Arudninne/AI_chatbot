# AI-Powered Financial Analysis Chatbot

## Description
This project involves the development of an AI-powered chatbot to assist in the analysis of corporate financial reports, specifically 10-K and 10-Q filings. The chatbot utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to extract, analyze, and provide insights from financial data. This project was part of my internship at BCG_X and aimed to automate financial analysis for Global Finance Corp. to support data-driven decision-making.
